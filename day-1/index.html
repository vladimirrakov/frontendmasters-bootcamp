    <h1 title="All About Me">All About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello word! My name is Vladimir. I am originally from Kyrgyzstan. Currently I live in Bern, Switzerland and learn
        coding.</p>
    <p>One of my hobbies is cooking on fire. I like cooking "Plov" or "Pilaf" in other cultures - a Central Asian dish
        that can feed an army of guests :)</p>
    <pre>
        If you wish to learn the recipe,
        please, google "How to cook an Uzbek pilaf" :)
        There will be plenty of info with
        pictures!
    </pre>
